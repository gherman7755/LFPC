# Advanced Parsing and Processing
It is created not for only one nfa
It takes only A, B, C ... Z states.
If there is no state in path just press 'enter' when you have to write state from path.
If you have 2 or more states in path it is neccessary to write them together.
Always write all paths for each state even if it is empty.
For e.g. if A state goes nowhere in paths a and b, you should write these paths and skip their filling.
If you have several final states just write and split them with space.
